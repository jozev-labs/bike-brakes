# bike-brakes
This repository contains the firmware for an early-stage bike motion sensing prototype built to evaluate whether braking and left/right leaning can be detected reliably using low-cost sensors and simple signal processing.  The system was intentionally built as a hardware-first feasibility test, not a production design.
